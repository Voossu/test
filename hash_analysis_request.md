# Hash Algorithm Reverse Engineering Project

## Overview
This project is focused on reverse engineering various hash algorithms to understand their structure and functionality. The primary goal is to analyze different hashing techniques and determine their vulnerabilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

## Objectives
- Study different hash algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).
- Implement reverse engineering techniques to analyze these algorithms.
- Document findings and provide insights into the security of these algorithms.

## Code Upload Request
To facilitate collaboration and enhance the project, team members are encouraged to upload their relevant code and findings related to hash algorithms. Please make sure to adhere to the following guidelines when uploading code:
- Include comments for clarity.
- Test your code thoroughly before submission.
- Ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards.
